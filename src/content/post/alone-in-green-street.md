Alone in the rain along Green Street’s avenue.

Trees dancing with the wind’s harmony.

Music loud, Heather’s melody.

The trees, they cease,

As mid-air droplets find their peace.

Echoes of steps, where droplets once fell.

Louder footsteps, hearts skip a beat.

Eyes lift up, a sight to behold.

Whispers a spell, memories fade,

Story untold.
