Is this really the final phase?

No more pain and working on fridays.

Wait... My alter will be alone,

till his own final phase?

…sigh.

I have to think me first.

I need to be at rest,

feel no stress.

I’ll see you again at the end.

Thanks for being my only friend.

Till then,

I’ll remain at the Great Unknown,

hope fate doesn’t postpone.
